## Usage

Execute `main_v2.py` to start the speed monitoring process. The script will perform network speed tests at the configured intervals and log the results in designated files.

```bash
python main_v2.py
```

##Logs
Speed test results are logged in the following files:
- `speedtest_log_Ethernet.txt` for Ethernet connections
- `speedtest_log_Wi-Fi.txt` for Wi-Fi connections

## Customization
Modify the `main_v2.py` script to adjust the target file type, test intervals, or other parameters according to your requirements.
